        - The objective of the study is to develop AI based models to predict the outcomes of Traumatic Brain Injury during the patient stay in ICU to aid clinical decision making and ultimately improve patient care
        - Implementation of explainable methods to allow the clinicians to understand and trust the models decision
        - This work combines multi-modality information of TBI patients at the bedside in ICU and predict patient outcomes in advance using classical ML models like KNN, Random Forest but when dealing with temporal signals, using LSTM and Transformers
